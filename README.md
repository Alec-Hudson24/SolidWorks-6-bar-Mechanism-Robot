# Solidworks Robot 6-bar mechanism
**Crab-inspired walking robot simulation using an 8-leg 6-bar linkage system with dual pinchers**  
*(Partner project: Mechanical design, SolidWorks motion simulation)*

## Goal/ Overview
- **Primary Features**:
  - Eight synchronized walking legs powered by 6-bar mechanisms for coordinated, stable gait
  - Dual pinchers (claws) integrated for thematic functionality and enhanced creativity
  - Crab-like aesthetic design to emphasize innovative expression
  - Achieves smooth, stable walking motion entirely without external stability mates or constraints
- **Motivation**: Develop a deeper understanding of how complex multi-bar linkages interact and coordinate in dynamic systems, while fostering creative freedom in student engineering design.
- **Outcome**: Complete, functional motion simulation demonstrating a full walking cycle, realistic crab-like locomotion, integrated claw movement, and scenic environment integration.

## Programs and skills required
- **3D Modeling & Design**: SolidWorks (part modeling, complex assemblies, advanced mates for linkage constraints)
- **SolidWorks Simulations**: Motion analysis setup (drivers, kinematic studies, interference checks, animation creation for gait visualization)

## Key Takeaways and lessons
- Investing time early to master efficient SolidWorks techniques (smart mates, configurations, motion study optimization) significantly accelerates future work — the initial learning curve is steep, but long-term efficiency gains are substantial.
- Multi-body dynamic systems demand careful management of degrees of freedom and constraint order to prevent instability or simulation failures.
- Creative elements (e.g., crab theme) boost engagement and presentation quality while maintaining rigorous technical validation.

## Future Improvements / Ideas
- Enable steering functionality (e.g., phase-shifted leg control for 90-degree turns)
- Redesign components with fabrication in mind (add tolerances, material considerations, simplify for 3D printing/CNC)
- Incorporate dynamic force/torque analysis for real motor sizing
- Experiment with gait variations or basic obstacle avoidance in simulation
